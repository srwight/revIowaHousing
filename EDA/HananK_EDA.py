Dependencies used (subject to change): pandas, numpy, scipy.stats

This .py file is meant to handle these 4 features/variables in feature engineering:
    GarageArea - the size/area of the garage in square feet - continuous
    GarageCars - the car capacity of the garage (number of cars) - continuous
    OpenPorchSF - the size/area of the open porch in square feet - continuous
    WoodDeckSF - the size/area of the wood deck in square feet - continuous
    
The function named feature_extract is where the dataset will be passed in & the 4 features
will be extracted for processing, including handling of missing values & outliers
and possibly normalization/handling of skewed data.

import pandas as pd # import pandas in order to be able to bring in the dataset

    A function for the extraction of these 4 variables/features:
        GarageArea
        GarageCars
        OpenPorchSF
        WoodDeckSF
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : pd.DataFrame
        This is the dataset that will be passed into the function (as a parameter) 
        for processing.

    Returns
    -------
    myFeatures : pd.DataFrame
        This is the DataFrame containing the 4 selected features (mentioned 
        above) that will be returned as output.

    Handling outliers by replacing the values of those outliers
    with the value used to filter the data or with some value close to it.
    I looked at the scatterplots between each feature and SalePrice & 
    estimated the max value of each feature(not including outliers).
    These max values were what I used to determine the filtering values.
